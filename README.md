RabbitMQSpring

Description
This project is associated with the DIO - Digital Innovation One - course, using Java to create an environment for asynchronous communication with the RabbitMQ system. If you want to learn more about the RabbitMQ messaging system, you can visit: RabbitMQ - O que são sistemas de mensageria?.

In this project, Java version 11 and the spring-rabbitmq API were utilized to establish different communication environments through the messaging system. The use case scenarios are described in the next section.

Regarding the messaging system, RabbitMQ is used and installed in a containerized environment with Docker. For Docker installation and configuration, you can refer to: Docker - Instalação e Configuração.

Access to RabbitMQ was demonstrated in the course using the terminal, web API, and through the Portainer interface. If you are interested in using Portainer.io, you can find installation and configuration instructions here: Portainer - Instalação e Configuração.
